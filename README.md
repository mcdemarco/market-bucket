# Market Bucket #

Market Bucket is a client-side web app for making and sharing lists.  It uses pnut.io (replacing app.net) for a data store.  

A pnut.io client id is required to run your own copy.

There is no build process; the code is the code.  If you edit the scss, you should use sass to recompile it:

	sass sectionalize.scss sectionalize.css
